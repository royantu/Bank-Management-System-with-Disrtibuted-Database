# Bank-Management-System-with-Disrtibuted-Database
The project is about simple banking system using Distributed database.

In this project i use the javafxml . Because you can design nicely with javafx with the third person software scenebuilder. 
For run the project you should careful about the ojbdc6.jar file and the username and the password of the database. I attached the ojbdc6.jar and my project's data table for your help.

Thank you.
